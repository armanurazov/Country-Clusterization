The country clusterization model created with K means clustering is a data mining technique that employs unsupervised learning to identify patterns and similarities among countries based on their multivariate characteristics. The K means algorithm partitions the countries into a predetermined number of clusters based on their proximity to the cluster centroids. The visual representation of the cluster results is achieved using Choropleth Maps, which are a form of thematic maps that use shading patterns to display the cluster distribution of countries on a geographic map. This model provides a quantitative approach to grouping countries and offers valuable insights into the underlying factors driving the cluster formation, which can be used to inform strategic decision-making in a variety of fields such as international relations, economics, and trade.
